# Summary
In summary, my project explores, using the provided baseball data, whether left-handed people are more naturally gifted with baseball than right-handed people. As a first step, I summarized the distribution of handedness in the dataset and found that right-handed people are the majority. Next, I gauged 
the relative prowess of two groups with respect to baseball in terms of batting average and the number of home runs scored, then found that by both metrics, lefties clearly are the winning group. Thus conclusion is reached and some revelation is drawn. 

# Design 
The major design choices that I made during the writing of the project are the types of graph used and the choice of user interaction type.

Some people may lament the lack of diversity of the type of plots used, but I explicitly chose barplots to illustrate my narratives for no other reason than the fact that the information is more centrally displayed and the focus on the narrative is underlined. In so doing, the flow of logic is flatter, making the narrative more appealing.
